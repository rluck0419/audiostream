### Procedurally generated ambient music

[Listen & Create Here](http://www.soundhouseapp.com)

SoundHouse is a procedurally-generated system of sounds, creating ambient music. By visiting the page, any user may listen in to a procedurally-generated piece of ambient music. After creating an account, users can specify their favorite sounds, scales, keys, and reverberation spaces. With these preferences, logged-in users can collaborate and contribute to a social-based system of ambient music.

This app is based on concepts of Music Systems, as described by Brian Eno in his conception of Ambient Music. In doing so, the concept of performer vs audience is nullified. Instead, a system of musical loops morphs over time, as notes overlap and spread out in unexpected ways. This has been described as creating a "garden of sound", where the composer has been removed from the performance, and instead takes on the role of an audience member.

By utilizing this concept of music systems and adding collaborative interactivity, the "audience" (users) can take on the roles of the performer and audience simultaneously. As users join and leave the session, the system continues to morph, creating a near-infinite number of possible musical combinations.

This app was created with the intent of providing user interaction and idle background sounds.

Enjoy.
